  <p style="margin-left:1em;">I think that to all living things there is a pleasure in the exercise of their energies...But a person at work, making something that she feels will exist because she is working at it and wills it, is exercising the energies of her mind and soul as well as of her body.  Memory and imagination help her as she works.  Not only her own thought, but the thoughts of those of past ages guide her hands; and as a part of the human race, she creates.  If we work thus we shall be [people], and our days will be happy and eventful. - Making is Connecting by David Gauntlett, 2009.</p>

    <p>
      Paul Yarabe is a budding web developer and strategist working in the ed tech area in Tokyo, Japan. His interests are wide, as he believes that science, teamwork, innovation, management, leadership, and creative, entrepreneurial know-how are all keys to helping young people achieve their dreams.  At Harvard, thanks to amazing mentors and the support of his family and friends, Paul found his way to cell biology, eventually researched the potential of stem cells in the hair follicle, and served as the American chair of the Japan-America Student Conference. Ready to take the next step, and challenged by entrpereneur and close friend Channing J. Harris (left), Paul is learning programming prior to starting his MBA at Harvard Business School this Fall.

    <h2 class="text-center">Coco</h2>
    <p>
      Coco, a half-Shihtzu, half...something dog, is the brains behind this operation.  She reminds Paul to take full advantage of everyday, and treasure his relationships with others.  As the mascot for Paul's (<a target="_blank" href="http://paulyarabe.com">website</a>) Coco is key in maintaining morale when Paul runs into problems coding.  Coco also played a major role in Paul's success in high school, waking him up almost every day and staying up until everyone in the house has fallen asleep.  She likes chicken, human food, getting lost, walks, and people not leaving the car.  She's also shy, runs up stairs fast, and spends a lot of time with mom.
